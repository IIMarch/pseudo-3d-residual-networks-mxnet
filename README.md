# Pseudo-3D Residual Networks

This repo implements the network structure of P3D[1] with MXNet, pre-trained model weights are converted from caffemodel, which is supported from the [author's repo](https://github.com/ZhaofanQiu/pseudo-3d-residual-networks)


### Pretrained weights

0. P3D ResNet trained on Sports-1M dataset:
