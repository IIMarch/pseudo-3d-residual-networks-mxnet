# Pseudo-3D Residual Networks (Not training code)

This repo implements the network structure of P3D[1] with MXNet, pre-trained model weights are converted from caffemodel, which is supported from the [author's repo](https://github.com/ZhaofanQiu/pseudo-3d-residual-networks)


### Pretrained weights

0. P3D ResNet trained on Sports-1M dataset: [BaiduYun url](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1boZFPHd)

1. P3D ResNet trained on Kinetics dataset: [Frame](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1bOmHPW)
